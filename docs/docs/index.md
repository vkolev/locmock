# Welcome to LocMock Documentation

This is a simple application server for mocking API services.

The idea is that you define your services and actions in a directory structure, providing information like:

* Expected path of the request
* Expected request
* Expected response

With this information when you call the locmock service you will get your predefined response.

## Starting the server
